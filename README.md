# Chantell Zibi - Data Analyst Portfolio

## About
HI, I am Chantell Zibi! I am a Civil Engineering graduate who is transitioning into a Data Analysis. I have studied with ALX to attain a Data Analysis certification and I am looking to start a role as a Junior Data Analyst in the next month. When I am not in-front of a computer studying, I like to read self-help books and listen to podcasts. In the near future I look forward to being one of the most influential women in the Big Data industry, empowering young women to lead.

While I was in school, I worked hard to hone in my analytical and communication skills. I am focused and attentive to detail when addressing high-volume task loads to meet deadlines. I am inspired by making a positive impact by applying my interpersonal skills and my problem solving abilities allow me to address challenges to achieve results.

My academic experiences have served me well in developing my communication, decision making and problem-solving skills. I work well to use clear and concise communication to interact professionally with colleagues, supervisors and customers.

This is a repository to showcase my skills, share projects and track my progress in Data Analysis/Science related topics.

## Portfolio Projects
  In this section I will list data analytics projects, briefly describing the technology stack used to solve cases.

 ### Maji Ndogo Data Exploration

**Project Overview:** This data analysis project aims to provide insights into water sources in Maji Ndogo that affect most people so that they can be improved to benefit the residents.

**Code:** [Data Exploration Project Queries: Maji Ndogo](https://github.com/ChantellZibi/Portfolio-Projects/blob/main/Maji%20Ndogo%20Data%20Exploration.sql)

**Description:** The database contains contains a water source table, a 'visits' table to record all the trips made to different water sources and the water quality table to find records   where the subjective quality score is within a certain range and the visit count is above a certain threshold.

**Skills:** Joins,CTE's, Windows Functions, Aggregate Functions, Creating Views

**Technology used:** SQL Server

**Results:** Looking at the river column, Sokoto has the largest population of people drinking river water so drilling equipment should be send out to Sokoto first, so people can drink safe filtered water from a well. The majority of water from Amanzi comes from taps, but half of these home taps don't work because the infrastructure is broken so engineering teams should be send out to look at the infrastructure in Amanzi first. Fixing a large pump, treatment plant or reservoir means that
thousands of people will have running water. This means they will also not have to queue for water, so this would improve two things at once.
