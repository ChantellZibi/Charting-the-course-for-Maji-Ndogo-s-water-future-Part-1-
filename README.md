# Chantell Zibi - Data Analyst Portfolio

## About
HI, I am Chantell Zibi! I am a Civil Engineering graduate who is transitioning into a Data Analysis. I have studied with ALX to attain a Data Analysis certification and I am looking to start a role as a Junior Data Analyst in the next month. When I am not in-front of a computer studying, I like to read self-help books and listen to podcasts. In the near future I look forward to being one of the most influential women in the Big Data industry, empowering young women to lead.

While I was in school, I worked hard to hone in my analytical and communication skills. I am focused and attentive to detail when addressing high-volume task loads to meet deadlines. I am inspired by making a positive impact by applying my interpersonal skills and my problem solving abilities allow me to address challenges to achieve results.

My academic experiences have served me well in developing my communication, decision making and problem-solving skills. I work well to use clear and concise communication to interact professionally with colleagues, supervisors and customers.

This is a repository to showcase my skills, share projects and track my progress in Data Analysis/Science related topics.
